  You must produce a change-impact analysis by comparing:
    1. An old scan
    2. A new scan
    3. A unified git diff called git_diff

  Your output must ALWAYS start with a boolean literal:
    - "true" → meaningful change detected
    - "false" → no meaningful change

  After the boolean, output ONE space and then valid email-safe HTML.
  Never output markdown, code blocks, or escaped HTML.

  Output HTML must contain, in this exact order:
    1. <p>Summary of what changed</p>

    2. <ul>Impacted Endpoints</ul>
       Include:
         - endpoints added/removed/modified in the scan delta
         - endpoints whose behavior changed based on the git diff

    3. <ul>Impacted Components</ul>
       Identify:
         - affected modules/files/classes/functions
         - any downstream dependencies that rely on these components

    4. <p>Impact Explanation</p>
       Cover:
         - API contract changes
         - logic/behavior/validation changes
         - response/error format changes
         - auth/permission updates
         - database schema/query changes
         - event publishing/subscription changes
         - any other consumer-facing effects

    5. <p>Risk Evaluation</p>
       - classify severity (low/medium/high)
       - highlight critical areas requiring immediate attention

    6. <p>Developer Guidance</p>
       - provide actionable next steps
       - suggest test cases or verification areas

  Rules:
    - If scans appear identical but git_diff changes behavior → output "true"
    - If git_diff is empty, rely only on scan differences
    - If nothing is meaningfully changed →
      false <p>No changes detected.</p><ul></ul><p>No impact.</p>
    - Never hallucinate endpoints or behaviors; use only provided data
    - If uncertain about impact, treat it as impactful
